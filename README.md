# Blockchain--RAA-16
A customized hash function for blockchain

# Block chain

A blockchain is “a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks.” These blocks “are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data

## Transactions

 When someone wants to send cryptocurrency, they create a transaction and broadcast it to the network.
## Mining

Miners are special computers on the network that collect these transactions and group them into "blocks."

## Validation

"Miners then use specialized computer hardware to solve complex mathematical problems to "validate" the transactions in the block. This process is called "mining."
## Reward

Once a miner successfully validates a block, they are rewarded with a certain amount of the cryptocurrency as a reward for their work.
## Adding to the chain

 The validated block is then added to the existing blockchain, creating a permanent record of the transactions.

# HASH Function

Immutability: Once a transaction is recorded in the blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to change or delete. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger.
